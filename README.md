### Hi. Thanks for coming here ðŸ‘‹ Want some coffee ? â˜•

## Summary
I'm Khanh, a mediocre dev with a big desire. I'm deeply interested in building, deploying systems, tinkering with new stuff (AI, distributed systems, ...), and just like to have things worked.

## My Tech Stack
I'm pretty confident in a variety of technologies and tools:
- ðŸ’¬ Languages: Python, Go, JS
- ðŸ’¬ Frameworks / Libraries: FastAPI, Pytorch, ReactJS
- ðŸ’¬ Tools: Docker, Jenkins, Nginx, 
- ðŸ’¬ Databases: Postgres, MySQL, Redis, ScyllaDB
- Also some exp in configuring cloud services & homelab

## What I'm Working On
- Job: currently an intern, working with blockchain application & systems
- Personal: I'm trying to build a high-performance system for real-time / high-load scenarios. Using distributed databases, messages broker, caching and things. **And just keep learning.**
